Preparing Work:
First,you have to install:cv2, numpy, PIL. You have already done that,right...haven't you?
Then make sure this:"haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml" and the programme are in the same file.

About the result:
the position(x and y) will be written in the DOS window,and the face will also be circled in the window called: screen detector.

About using:
Turn On: click "face detector.py"
Turn Off:  put your mouse on window, then click it and press button"esc"
	Or just shut down the DOS winsow.

PS: I'm a Chinese, so there it may has some mistakes,if it does,just skip the mistakes please.
